## Requirements Analysis
1. <strong>Product Catalog</strong>: A page that displays all products, categorized by type. Each product will have a thumbnail image, title, price, and a button to add the product to the shopping cart.

2. <strong>Product Details</strong>: A detailed view of a single product. This page will display a larger image, title, description, price, and an option to add the product to the shopping cart.

3. <strong>Shopping Cart</strong>: A page where users can view the products they've added to the cart, adjust quantities, remove products, view the total price, and proceed to checkout.

4. <strong>Checkout</strong>: A page where users can review their order, enter shipping information, and finalize their purchase.

5. <strong>User Authentication</strong>: A system for users to register, log in, and manage their account. This is essential for tracking orders and providing a personalized shopping experience.

6. <strong>Search and Filtering</strong>: A feature to allow users to search for products and filter the product catalog based on category.

7. <strong>Responsive Design</strong>: The store should be accessible and functionally consistent across different devices and screen sizes.

Of course, a <strong>Navigation bar</strong> is included. It can house links to various parts of the site, such as the product catalog, shopping cart, and user account


## Planning and Design
We're going to need a few key pages:

Home Page: This page will welcome users to NeuraCanvas, offer a brief introduction about what we offer, and display some featured products.

Product Catalog Page: This page will display our products, categorized by Digital Art, Realistic Photo, and Pattern.

Product Details Page: This page will provide more information about a specific product, including a larger image, a description, and the option to add the product to the cart.

Shopping Cart Page: This page will allow users to view, add, or remove items in their cart and proceed to the checkout process.

Checkout Page: This page will enable users to review their order, enter shipping details, and finalize the purchase.

User Authentication Pages: These will include the Login and Register pages.

User Account Page: This page will allow users to manage their account, track their orders, and modify their personal information.

In addition, we'll have a Navigation Bar at the top of every page with links to Home, Product Catalog, Shopping Cart, and User Account, along with the NeuraCanvas logo.

Given that we're using Material UI, we have a rich set of prebuilt components at our disposal, which will make the development process smoother and faster. We should also ensure that the design is responsive, as per our requirements.
